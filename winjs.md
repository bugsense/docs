## Windows 8 / JS

### Using the Javascript library

Download the <a href="">bugsense-<strong></strong>.js</a><strong><a href="/releases/html5" id="releases">(Release Notes)</a></strong> file and store in it along with you other Javascript files. Alternatively you can use the BugSense hosted version (see the following Gist). 

Then all you have to do is to include the script in the default.html page and page initialize it.
